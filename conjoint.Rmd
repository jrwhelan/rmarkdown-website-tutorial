## Introduction

Market researchers may be familiar with a `conjoint` exercise, a choice methodology used in surveys to break down the value of products to the sum of its components. By asking respondents to repeatedly choose their favourite option among a set of discrete choices, with variable components generated by an experimental design, we can estimate models around which options we can expect consumers to prefer. This way we can project more likely winning products to add or modify products in the market.


`formr` offers an interesting interface to build and run surveys with `R`.
